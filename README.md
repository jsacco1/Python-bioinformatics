# Bioinformatics

This repo contains bioinformatics scripts in Python. They do not need their own repositories. I wrote the BLAST scripts to programmatically analyze results of multiple sequence alignment. Later, I focused on programmatically accessing and analyzing NGS data from public genomic databases such as NCBI GDC. 

## TODO: 
Add more scripts focused on NGS such as bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq.
